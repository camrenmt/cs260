							Those who understand the eternal blessings which come from the temple 
							know that no sacrifice is too great, no price too heavy, 
							no struggle too difficult in order to receive those blessings. 
							There are never too many miles to travel, too many obstacles to overcome, 
							or too much discomfort to endure. ~ President Thomas S Monson
